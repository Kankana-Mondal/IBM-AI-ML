## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease.  
The notebook walks through the following stages:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
4. **Model Training (Logistic Regression / Others)**  
5. **Performance Evaluation**  
6. **Visualizations (Scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.)**



## 📦 Dataset Details

The dataset (`heart disease.csv`) includes features such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Cholesterol  
- Blood Pressure  
- Heart Disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- Other health metrics  



## 🛠 Requirements

If your notebook uses external libraries, add them here. Example:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn


## 📈 Results Summary

Model outputs include:

- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve / AUC Score  
- Visualized predictions
